# eFabrica Nette Database Repository

This extension enhances the static analysis of your Nette Database by providing typehinted entities (ActiveRows), queries (Selections) and
repositories (services).

## Installation

You can install this extension using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), the dependency manager for PHP:

```sh
composer require efabrica/nette-repository
```

To enable the extension, you need to register it in config:

```neon
extensions:
    netteRepo: Efabrica\NetteRepository\Bridge\EfabricaNetteRepositoryExtension
```

Finally, you can run the repository code generation command to generate the necessary classes and files:

```sh
$ php vendor/bin/enc
```

## Usage

### Entity

The `Entity` class is a subclass of ActiveRow that serves as a superclass for your entities.
You can either use our code generation tool to create it automatically or write it manually.

#### Inserting an entity

```php
assert($repository instanceof PersonRepository);
assert($entity instanceof Person);
$entity = $repository->create();
$entity->name = 'John';
$entity->surname = 'Doe';
$entity->age = 42;
$entity->save();
```

Save array:

```php
$entity = $repository->insertOne([
    Person::NAME => 'John',
    Person::SURNAME => 'Doe',
    Person::AGE => 42,
]); // always returns entity

// More verbose approach:
$entity = $repository->create();
$entity->fill([
    Person::NAME => 'John',
    Person::SURNAME => 'Doe',
    Person::AGE => 42,
]);
$entity->save();
```

Classic:

```php
$person = $repository->insert([
    Person::NAME => 'John',
    Person::SURNAME => 'Doe',
    Person::AGE => 42,
]); // always returns Entity
```

Multi-insert:

```php
$persons = [];
foreach (range(30, 40) as $age) {
    $person = $repository->createRow();
    Person::NAME => 'John',
    Person::SURNAME => 'Doe',
    Person::AGE => $age,
    $persons[] = $person;
}
$repository->insertMany($persons); // always returns int
```

#### Updating an entity

```php
$entity = $repository->find($id);
$entity->name = 'Jake';
$entity->update(); // or $entity->save();
```

Classic:

```php
$repository->update($id, [Person::name => 'Jake']);
```

#### Deleting an entity

```php
$repository->delete($id);
```

Or, if you already have the entity available:

```php
$entity = $repository->find($id);
$entity->delete();
```

### Scopes

Scope is a class that defines which existing behaviors are disabled for the Repository, Query and Entity.

The active Scope is passed down from Repository to Query and from Query down to Entity.

`->withScope(Scope $scope)` returns a clone of the object with the given scope applied.

`->scopeRaw()` returns a clone of the object with raw scope. Raw scope removes all behaviors.

`->scopeFull()` returns a clone of the object with full scope. Full scope keeps all behaviors. 
This is the default scope, unless you change the scope in repository's setup() method.

#### Example

```php
final class AdminScope implements \Efabrica\NetteRepository\Repository\Scope\Scope
{
    public function apply(RepositoryBehaviors $behaviors, Repository $repository): void
    {
        // Remove these behaviors because they are not needed for the Admin
        $behaviors
            ->remove(SoftDeleteBehavior::class)
            ->remove(PublishBehavior::class);
        
        // Do not add any new behaviors here, because this scope can be used by different repositories
        // and you might introduce unwanted side effects.
        
        // However, you can conditionally add behaviors based on the repository type and some parameter
        // For example, if you want to apply a special behavior for admin users in the user repository, you can do this:
        if ($repository instanceof UserRepository && $someContainerParameter) { // Scopes can be services and receive parameters.
            $behaviors->add(AdminBehavior::class); // This is a hypothetical behavior, just for illustration.
        }
    }
}
```

To use the Scope as a **container service**, which may not be necessary in your case, please follow these steps:

```php
use Efabrica\NetteRepository\Repository\RepositoryBehaviors;
abstract class RepositoryBase extends \Efabrica\NetteRepository\Repository\Repository
{
    /** @inject */
    public AdminScope $adminScope;
    
    public function scopeAdmin(): self
    {
        return $this->withScope($this->adminScope);
    }
    
    // Do this if you want to set the AdminScope as default:
    protected function setup(RepositoryBehaviors $behaviors) : void 
    {
        $behaviors->setScope($this->adminScope);
    }
}
```

And **optionally** implement shorthand methods for your queries:

```php
use YourBeautifulApplication\Admin\AdminScope;

abstract class QueryBase extends \Efabrica\NetteRepository\Repository\Query
{
    public function scopeAdmin(): self
    {
        // This method returns a copy of the query with your own Admin scope applied
        // The Admin scope removes some behaviors that are not relevant for the Admin
        return $this->withScope($this->repository->adminScope);
        // Alternatively, if the Admin scope does not depend on any parameters, you can create a new instance of it like this:
        return $this->withScope(new AdminScope());
    }
}
```

Usage:

```php
// all of these are equivalent:
$repository->findBy(['age > ?' => 18])->scopeAdmin()->fetchAll();
$repository->scopeAdmin()->findBy(['age > ?' => 18])->fetchAll();
$repository->query()->where('age > ?', 18)->scopeAdmin()->fetchAll();
$repository->scopeAdmin()->query()->where('age > ?', 18)->fetchAll();
$repository->query()->scopeAdmin()->where('age > ?', 18)->fetchAll();
```

## Code Generator

Code generation is fully optional, but it is recommended to use it.

>To run the code generation, use this command:
>```sh
>$ php bin/console efabrica:nette-repo:code-gen
># OR
>$ php bin/console e:n:c
># OR 
>$ php vendor/bin/enc
>```

For every table in the database, it will generate these classes in the `/Generated/` namespace: (Example: `person` table)

- `Repository\Generated\Repository\PersonRepositoryBase` - Repository base class, holds typehints for `PersonQuery` and `Person` entity. (
  abstract)
- `Repository\Generated\Query\PersonQuery` - Query class, holds typehints for `Person` entity. (abstract)
- `Repository\Generated\Entity\Person` - Entity class, holds types for columns and public constants for column names. (final)

These classes are **always regenerated** when you run the code generator. They should not be modified manually.

For every table in the database, it will also generate these classes **outside** of the `/Generated/` namespace, but only if they don't
exist. If they exist, they will not be overwritten:

- `Repository\PersonRepository` - extends `PersonRepositoryBase`. Here you write your custom repository methods. (final)
- `Repository\Query\PersonQuery` - extends `PersonQuery`. Here you write your custom query methods. (final)
- `Repository\Entity\PersonBody` - trait that is inserted into `Person` entity. Here you write your custom entity methods. (trait)

These classes are **not regenerated** when you run the code generator. They are meant to be customized by you. If you want to regenerate
them, you have to delete them first.

#### Ignoring tables

It is also possible to ignore some tables. To do that, you can modify the `ignoredTables` parameter in the config file:

```neon=
netteRepo:
    ignoreTables:
        # These are the defaultly ignored tables:
        migrations: true
        migration_log: true
        phoenix_log: true
        phinxlog: true
```

#### Custom Inheritance

If you want to set different `extends` or `implements` for a generated class, you can do that by adding an entry into your config file:

```neon
netteRepo:
    inheritance:
        AuthorRepositoryBase:
            extends: 'App\Repository\PeopleRepositoryBase'
            implements: ['App\Repository\PersonRepositoryInterface']
        AuthorQuery:
            extends: 'App\Repository\PeopleQueryBase'
        Person:
            implements: ['App\Repository\PersonInterface']
```

- Every generated class can be used for this. 
- Key is the short class name (without namespace). 
<small>Generated classes are made such that there are no namespace collisions, so this shouldn't prove a problem.</small>
- `extends` must be string or null/not specified. 
- `implements` must be string array or empty array or null/not specified. 
- You cannot unimplement an interface.

This config schema is a bit verbose, but very intuitive once you see it and easy to read.

## Behaviors and Traits

#### DateBehavior

This behavior automatically sets the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to the current date and time when inserting or updating a row.

#### FilterBehavior

This behavior applies a default where() condition to every select query.

#### KeepDefaultBehavior

This behavior ensures that there is always at least one row with a truthy value in the default column. This is useful for flag columns.

#### SoftDeleteBehavior

This behavior marks a row as deleted by setting the `deleted_at` column to the current date and time instead of removing it from the table.

You can replace value in column with unique key for allow insert new record with same unique value. For example: 
```php
$behaviors
    ->add(
        new SoftDeleteBehavior(Genre::DELETED_AT, uniqueColumns: [
            Genre::TITLE => new SqlLiteral('CONCAT(`' . Genre::TITLE . '`, "_", UNIX_TIMESTAMP())'),
        ])
    );
```

#### LastManStandingBehavior

This behavior prevents deleting the last row in the table that matches a given query.

#### TreeTraverseBehavior

This behavior manages the `lft` and `rgt` columns that represent the hierarchical structure of the table. It updates them automatically when
inserting or updating a row.

#### SortingTrait

This trait adds methods to the repository for changing the order of rows, such as moveUp(), moveDown(), insertBefore(), and insertAfter().

#### CastBehavior

This behavior automatically casts values to the specified type when retrieving them from the database.

There are some predefined casts, but you can also define your own.

- `JsonCastBehavior`: casts values from JSON to PHP array and vice versa.
- `CarbonCastBehavior`: casts values from MySQL datetime to CarbonImmutable and vice versa.

#### Events

There are several events that you can listen to in your repository: Insert, Update, Delete, Select, Load

To implement your own event subscriber, create a new class that extends `Efabrica\NetteRepository\Subscriber\EventSubscriber` and register
it in the container. It will get automatically detected, since it extends the EventSubscriber.
